# Data Structures And Algorithms üìñ
This is my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! The collection is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts in computer science, focusing on various data structures and algorithms. My aim is to enhance understanding and practical application of these critical topics, which are essential for efficient problem-solving and software development.

## What Are Data Structures?
Data Structures are ways to organize data based on its nature and intended use. Consider a family tree as a real-world example: it is designed to show relationships between family members, making it easy to trace connections, such as finding your grandmother's name. Without this structured organization, understanding these relationships would be much more difficult.

##  What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a sequence of precise steps to solve a problem or reach a goal. Like a recipe provides instructions to make a meal, algorithms in computer science provide instructions (written in programming code) that manipulate data structures to accomplish tasks. Efficient algorithms are crucial for optimizing program performance.

## Repository Structure
